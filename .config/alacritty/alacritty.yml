env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

#     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
#
# Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
#     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
#     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons

# Values for `startup_mode`:
#   - Windowed

# Override the variant of the GTK theme. Commonly supported values are `dark` and `light`.
# Set this to `None` to use the default theme variant.

# Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  #offset:
    #x: -1
    #y: -1
  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
